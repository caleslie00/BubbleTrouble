How to Test our A Proposal:

Adding "-p" followed by a number specifies the power we are going to raise our values to when doing pagerank,
so if someone made 4 choices and the input for power was "-p 2" pagerank would see it as [16, 9, 4, 1] rather than [4, 3, 2, 1].

Adding "-s" followed by one of 'f' for fibonacci sequence, 'r' for Receman's sequence, or 'p' for Pascals trianlge will invoke
pagerank to use those sequences instead of using the power of p. If a sequence is successfully inputted, it will override whatever
power is inputted because it's harder to accidentally input a sequence than a polynomial. So, if someone chose "-s p" and made 6 choices
the pagerank would see [20, 10, 6, 3, 2, 1] instead of [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

Sample test prompts(place what is between double quotes between the correct test directory and input file, add other commands if you wish):

Test to see if "-p" works: 
"-p 0"  (should make pagerank x^1 by default)
"-p 1"  (should make pagerank x^1)
"-p 2"  (should make pagerank x^2)
"-p 3"  (should make pagerank x^3)

Test to see if "-s" works: 
"-s f"  (should make pagerank fibonacci sequence)
"-s r"  (should make pagerank Recaman's sequence)
"-s p"  (should make pagerank Pascal's triangle)
"-s f -p 2"  (should make pagerank fibonacci sequence and override "-p 2")
