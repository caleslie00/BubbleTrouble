# BubbleTrouble
Carter Leslie, SK Hall, and Abi Verhelle's project for Dr. Reeve's CS374.01 Project 2: GoogleHappy

* If you are an instructer, a professor, or someone that works with teams often, you know team selection can be a hard task. That is why BubbleTrouble was made to solve the problem. The BubbleTrouble program uses sophisticated algorithms that easily assigns people in to teams, and even calculates individual and group happiness in the team. If no one is happy with the team, BubbleTrouble also has a swap algorithm that keeps swapping people in different teams until everyone is happy with their team. Creating teams has never been easier.

User Stories
=============

* As a quadcopter instructor, I want to sort my students into teams where they'll be happiest.

* As a quadcopter instructor, I wish to have a choice as to how my students are ranked.

Why are we here? 
------------
-The purpose of the project is the design a system that can randomly assign people to teams based on their selected preferences. Our current customer is a quadcopter instructor that is needing to create teams for an upcoming student competition. He is needing to take those that have signed up for the competition and dristribut them into teams based on who they each would like to work with.

Pitch
---------
-For instructors who need to organize students into teams, the BubbleTrouble sorting system is a sorting program that sorts students based on their preferences, both positive and negative unlike Canvas' random team creation program.

The Not List
------
-For this program, there isn’t going to be any user interface. It is a program to run from the terminal only. Also, this program won’t need internet connection to run, so there is no need to worry about that.

Meet Your Neigbors
---
-This project only had three people working on it. There wasn’t any third party or anyone else less directly involved with the project that we could meet with.

Our Solution
---------
-What makes the BubbleTrouble sorting system different is that students will be able to list their preferences for other students in a descending list, with the most preferred at the top and scaling down. This will be implemented through a method much like Google's RatePage algorithm that uses weighted links between students.

What keeps us up at night:
----
-This project doesn’t have many risks. The major problem is going to be the fact that the team is no longer co-located. This issue can raise problems in terms of not being able to have in-person brainstorming sessions, misscommunication and losing the ability to create bonds between teammates.

Size it up: 
---
-The project is expected to be for four weeks. The first week will consist of brainstorming and building the project’s basic framework along with creating the basic documentation.

Be clear on what is going to give
---
For this project, time is the most important thing, followed by quality, then scope. There is not a budget needed for the project. The goal is to spend at least 3 hours a week working on the project, and to deliver working software by the end of the four weeks.

What is it going to take:
---
-It is going to take team collaboration and dedication to finish the project, as well as good team communication especially since we are no longer co-located.
