# How to Run
===============

1. git clone https://github.com/caleslie00/BubbleTrouble.git
2. One you have the clone, you must go into src > main > java and compile GoogleHappy.java with java. For example, with the terminal, do "javac GoogleHappy.java"
3. Then, you must run the GoogleHappy class with java. Using the terminal, imputting "java GoogleHappy" will run the file, but you also need to pass it an input file to run it on. Any of the .txt files will work, so the total text to run the code will look like "java GoogleHappy < labRatsTest.txt" if you wanted to run the code on the labRatsTest.txt file.
4. To test additional functionality of the program, entering some string args after can manipulate the way the program runs. Entering -t and then a number sets the team size from 2 to half the class size, entering -v and then an integer sets the verbosity level from 0-4, entering -p and then an integer decides the degree of the polynomial determining the pagerank scaling from 1+, entering -s and then either f, r, or p will overrule -p and set the scaling to fibonacci sequence, recaman's sequence, or pascal's triangle sequence respectively. For example, "java GoogleHappy < labRatsTest.txt -v 1 -s f -t 4" will run the program on labRatsTest.txt with verbosity set to 1, the pagerank sequence set to fibonacci, and the team size set to 4.
